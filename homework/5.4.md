Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last "terraform apply"
which may have affected this plan:

  # yandex_compute_instance.node01 has been deleted
  - resource "yandex_compute_instance" "node01" {
        id                        = "fhm1tcki3c9io9gl5gp5"
        name                      = "node01"
        # (10 unchanged attributes hidden)

      ~ network_interface {
          - ip_address         = "192.168.101.12" -> null
          - nat_ip_address     = "51.250.66.20" -> null
            # (8 unchanged attributes hidden)
        }

        # (5 unchanged blocks hidden)
    }


Unless you have made equivalent changes to your configuration, or ignored the relevant attributes using
ignore_changes, the following plan may include actions to undo or respond to these changes.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
